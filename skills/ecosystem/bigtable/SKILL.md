# Bigtable Skill

This skill provides core workflows and guidance for administering and developing with Google Bigtable. 

## Core Principles

- **Control Plane vs. Data Plane:**
  - Use **`gcloud`** for Control Plane operations: Manage Instances, Clusters, App Profiles, Backups and IAM. Create Tables, Logical Views, Materialized Views and Authorized Views.
  - Use **`cbt`** for Data Plane operations: Update Tables, Column Families, and reading/writing data.
- **Performance First:** Bigtable is a NoSQL database. Efficiency is tied to Row Key design. Always warn about Full Table Scans.
- **Client Selection:** For production use cases, **Java** or **Go** are preferred for their superior performance and feature coverage compared to other languages.
- **Observability:** When diagnosing performance or hotspotting, **ALWAYS** mention **Key Visualizer** (via Cloud Console) as the primary diagnostic tool, followed by hot-tablets tool and table stats in gcloud CLI and `include-stats=full` option under `cbt read` to diagnose slow queries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Safety Rule:** Always obtain explicit user confirmation before making non-emulator database changes.

## Quick Recipes

### 1. Querying Data
Use SQL for complex transforms or aggregations and key-value APIs for simpler query patterns.
*Note: Use exact match, prefix (_key LIKE 'myprefix%') or range predicates on `_key` to avoid expensive unbounded scans.*

If expensive scans (either unbounded or prefix or range queries scanning a large range) are unavoidable due to multiple access patterns that can’t all be accommodated in a single schema, consider one of these two options:
- If the query  will be used in user facing and/or latency sensitive applications, use continuous materialized views with keys optimized for the additional access patterns.
- If secondary access patterns are infrequent, batch patterns like ETL, ML model training or analytical read-only tasks, use Bigtable Data Boost instead. 

### 2. Manipulating Data
Use key-value APIs for insert, update, increment and delete operations. SQL API is read-only.

### 3. Data Model Definition (DDL)
SQL API doesn't support DDL operations. Table creation, deletion, updates should be made using gcloud CLI. Logical Views and Continuous Materialized Views are defined as SQL queries but they must be created using gcloud CLI. 

## Reference Guides

  - [cli_data_access.md](references/cli_data_access.md) - Reading and writing data via the `cbt` CLI.
- **Design & Discovery**:
  - [schema_design.md](references/schema_design.md) - Best practices for row keys and performance with tables and continuous materialized views.
  - [dataplex.md](references/dataplex.md) - Data catalog search for Bigtable assets.
- **Querying & Code**:
  - [sql_guide.md](references/sql_guide.md) - Querying structured row keys via SQL and CLI.
  - [client_libraries.md](references/client_libraries.md) - Patterns for high-performance Go/Java/Python code.

## Common Workflows

### Schema Evolution (DevOps)
1. **Prefer Terraform** for production schema changes to prevent accidental data loss.
2. For manual `cbt` changes, verify column family GC policies:
   ```bash
   cbt createfamily [TABLE] [FAMILY]
   cbt setgcpolicy [TABLE] [FAMILY] "maxversions=5 AND maxage=30d"
   ```
3. Reference [infrastructure_management.md](references/infrastructure_management.md) for full syntax.
